This repository contains the accompanying code of the paper "Local points on $X_E^{-}(p)$" by Nuno Freitas and Diana Mocanu.

In our computations, we used Magma V2.28-20 on a machine running Ubuntu 22.04.4 with an AMD Opteron Processor 6380 with 8 cores and 32 GB RAM. 
Most of our computations finish within a few minutes.

The files "Table1.m", "Table2.m", "Table3.m" verify the claims in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 respectively. All involve checking local properties of elliptic curves defined over the 2-adics or 3-adics.

The file "GoodReduction.m" verifies the claims in Examples 5.8, 5.10 and 5.11 from Section 5: The case of good reduction.
